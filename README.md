# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions to the Advent of Code programming contest December 2022.

## What is this project about?

Advent of Code website:  [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

Solutions are in C# and cross platform .NET 7 framework unless otherwise noted.

My goals for this year's AoC are to have fun, and apply
the functional programming techniques in C# 11.  I'll make
full use of .NET's built-in collections and for graph traversals the [QuikGraph](https://github.com/KeRNeLith/QuikGraph) graph algorithmm library.

## Notes

### Day 1

Don't forget the last line of input if not blank!

### Day 2

Took me quite a while to realize a draw is each player throwing the same item but must account for differnt values they have in each column of the data.
